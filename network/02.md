Bridge (br0)
➤ What it is:
A software switch that connects multiple interfaces together, forwarding traffic between them at Layer 2 (Ethernet level).

➤ Typical use cases:
Allowing virtual machines or containers to share the host network

Connecting multiple interfaces into one logical network (e.g., eth0 and tap0)

Used by tools like KVM, LXC, and Docker


when bridging the 2 networks, both network won't get individual IPs, instead it will get one IP for both.
